# Quantum Computing 

A personal repository documenting my journey into **quantum computing** — concepts, notes, experiments, and implementations as I learn and build.

This repo is part study journal, part lab notebook, and part project space.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build intuition for quantum mechanics in computing  
- Understand how quantum algorithms differ from classical ones  
- Get hands-on with quantum SDKs like Pennylane and simulators  
- Implement foundational and advanced quantum algorithms  
- Track progress over time

---

## 🧠 Purpose

Quantum computing is fundamentally different from classical computing. Writing code and explaining concepts in my own words helps turn abstract math into intuition and builds a deeper understanding of quantum advantage.

## 🚧 Status

This is a **living learning repository**.
